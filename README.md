Data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime+unnormalized

This is my Data Analysis project for the course Math 180 offered by UC Merced. 
My contributions to this project are loading in the data, splitting the data, normalizing the data and peforming Lasso Regression onto the data. 
I peformed a Lasso regression to the Unnormalized Crime and Communities Data set offered by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Reporository to see which predictors are the most important to our analysis. 
During my regression, for each response variable Y, murder, arson, and etc, we found there had been different predictors for each in which we had to view in the scope of our research. 
Our research questions: 
Does a Socioeconomic Status of a Community Play a Role in Crime Rate in the U.S.?
How can Law Enforcements reduce socioeconomic disparities among these communities? What are resources that the government can provide to reduce the crime rates in cities?
