This is a summary of my data analysis project completed for the Math 180 course at UC Merced. As part of this project, I contributed to critical data preparation tasks, including data loading, splitting, and normalization, in addition to performing Lasso Regression on the Unnormalized Crime and Communities Data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Through the application of Lasso Regression, we aimed to identify the most influential predictors in relation to murders in a population, and subsequently, investigated possible independent variables that may contribute to this response variable. To further our understanding of the data, we utilized a Regression tree, allowing us to visualize the contributing factors of violent crime and potential measures for preventing such crimes from occurring. Our response variable was measured in terms of murder per population, and we investigated different possible independent variables that may have contributed to the occurrence of this response variable.

Working collaboratively as a group, we explored other models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Linear Regression, with a focus on optimizing results for easy readability and interpretation. Specifically, my Regression Tree model demonstrated exceptional performance, with a low error rate of 0.007030662.

To accomplish this project, we utilized multiple packages and libraries in R Studio, including RandomForest, caret, glmnet, dplyr, corrplot, and tree, enabling us to model and visualize the dataset effectively. Our research questions revolved around the impact of a community's socioeconomic status on crime rates in the U.S., and potential strategies that law enforcement and government can implement to reduce crime rates in cities.

In conclusion, this project represents a comprehensive and rigorous examination of crime and community data, utilizing advanced statistical techniques to provide valuable insights and actionable recommendations for addressing violent crime.
